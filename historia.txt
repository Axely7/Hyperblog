The first book was adapted from the first four radio episodes (the Primary Phase), 
with Arthur being rescued from Earth's destruction by Ford, meeting Zaphod and Trillian, 
coming to the planet of Magrathea to discover the true purpose of life, and ending with the group preparing to go 
to the Restaurant at the End of the Universe. It was first published in 1979, initially in paperback, by Pan Books, 
after BBC Publishing had turned down the offer of publishing a novelization, an action they would later regret.[28] 
The book reached number one on the book charts in only its second week, and sold over 250,250
